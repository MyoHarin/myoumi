Hi\! Name's MyoHarin (虚梅). Currently an undergrad computer science student at London. I'm also an amateur jazz pianist, production artist for games and film soundtracks above all\!

Welcome to my void sea (虚海) of random personal rants and where I post devlogs of my personal computer science and music projects, as well as analysis and commentary on some of the niche corners of the world I've been spoon feeding my reality. So yes, welcome to my 3 am discovery channel\!

For a digestible scroll of my current most relevant works, please visit [my soundcloud\!](https://soundcloud.com/myoharin)

## My Blogging Setup

I'm using Chirpy\! A Jekyll theme spear-headed by [cotes2020](https://github.com/cotes2020). And this whole blog idea is inspired by raphaellith's [The-Dumping-Ground](https://raphaellith.github.io/The-Dumping-Ground/). Blogs are drafted up in google docs, exported as markdowns before they are touched up in vscode\!

## What does "Myo" mean?

Void. It means void. I've always adored the concept of void, nothingless, a melancholic tranquility humanity wants to describe beyond the numeric symbol "0".

### Inspirations for my Name

I'm firstly inspired by Hollowknight and it's community of void, where its just a thrashing mass of undefined consciousness, contained in these dolls, shells dangerous and devastating to all, enough to make a grown man tear(yes I'm talking about the Kingsmould at the end of Path of Pain). The community are also keen to make their own void-sonas and honestly I wanna join this movement without so blatantly piggy-backing off of the game. Just feel sorta cliche to let my identity be defined by a game, especially one that's been tainted(as of 2025\)

My second inspiration for what void is comes from Rainworld, a metaphysical / philosophical / transcendental interpretation of what the void is. It is a tangible matter that interacts with the intangible "self", an antithesis to what it is to be, yet it simply is. What better word to describe such an abstract concept than the already abstract "void" we have?

### Origin of My Name

With this fascination, I've decided to incorporate "void" into my online presence\! Using the word "void" just seems so cringe and edgy, so I decide to do the second cringiest thing: *using words of another language*. I wanted to use the japanese word for void is 虚, which is usually pronounced "kyo", so I brainstormed names and names and- every name is just twice as edgy as the large, or sounds sorta stupid when misheard or mistranslated…Eventually I just sorta settled for an old dnd character's name "MyoHarin", a druid-like sorcerer(bless Laserllama and their homebrews) and changed the 'k' to an 'm' (don't worry I'll invent a language to justify using "myo" for void).

Here's the full justification and translation for my name that nobody ever asked for\! "Myo" stands for void, Harin means "deer" in Sanskrit, which is "梅花鹿" in Chinese (technically sika deer to be specific). Harin also means "jade" in Korean but I'm sticking to the flowy side of things so, picking out the first character "梅", MyoHarin means: VoidPlum (虚梅).

## Longevity

I am honestly not sure how this blog will evolve. Currently it's a one stop for all solutions for all my social-media publication needs, and if I ever do a more focused brand image, I will ofcourse migrate my blogging solution. Otherwise, this stays for as long as I live\!
